Git (/ɡɪt/ ⓘ[8]) is a distributed version control software system[9] that is capable of managing versions of source code or data. It is often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.
Design goals of Git include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows—thousands of parallel branches running on different computers.
As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, Git maintains a local copy of the entire repository, also known as the "repo", with history and version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. 
A repository is stored on each computer in a standard directory with additional, hidden files to provide version control capabilities.
Git provides features to synchronize changes between repositories that share history; for asynchronous collaboration, this extends to repositories on remote machines.
Although all repositories (with the same history) are peers, developers often use a central server to host a repository to hold an integrated copy.
Git is free and open-source software shared under the GPL-2.0-only license.
Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds for version control in the development of the Linux kernel.
The trademark "Git" is registered by the Software Freedom Conservancy.
Today, Git is the version control system most commonly used by software developers.
It is the most popular distributed version control system, with nearly 95% of developers reporting it as their primary version control system as of 2022.
It is the most widely used source-code management tool among professional developers. 
There are offerings of Git repository services, including GitHub, SourceForge, Bitbucket and GitLab.
