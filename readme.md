# QA Notes

This repository is my personal learning space as I transition into QA. I created it to document everything I study, from basic concepts to hands-on practice, so I can better understand how software testing works.
It’s a mix of notes, summaries, and exercises. It's a foundation I plan to expand step by step on my way to becoming a Junior QA Engineer.
